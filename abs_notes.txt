chapter 1 Introduction

I think it is better to read it with the very first chapters of \`bash info\'.
Keywords: Posix, Unix, Shell, Bash, Ksh

Unix shell can interpreter command and execute it.
It provides tons of system utilities and builtin functions for user interface.

Shell, as in interactive mode and non-interactive mode:
What tasks can I accomplish with an interactive shell?
Type command from keyboard and execute them, get result.

What tasks can I accomplish with an non-interactive shell?
Combine system utilities and create powerful script to accomplish complex system tasks.

1. System administrators often write scripts to automate common
tasks. Give several instances where such scripts would be useful.

(1) : Write startup scripts to autoload network configuration files, such as proxy...
(2) : Execute scheduled tasks, such as archiving and cleaning log files. 
(3) : System monitor, e.g. use top to get process statistics and record.

2. Write a script that upon invocation shows the time and date,
   lists all logged-in users, and gives the system uptime. The
   script then saves this information to a logfile.

#!/bin/bash
exec >>~/dummy_logs
date; w; uptime;
echo; echo; echo;
exit
