Chapter 1 Getting Started

[On most systems, the value returned from main is a status indicator.]
In Unix-like systems, the status code may be captured by the command interpreter(typically, a shell)

[A return value
of 0 indicates success. A nonzero return has a meaning that is defined by
the system.]
This statement is not exact.
为何这么说呢, 返回值的含义并不是由操作系统(kernel)决定的, 而应该是程序本身决定的。
E.g. pgrep command in Linux. The meaning of non-zero return code is specified by its manual.

The important of strong-type programming language: maintainance.
难以使用无类型语言开发一个超大型系统...
Javascript -> Typescript

[Compilers usually include options to generate warnings about problematic
constructs. It is usually a good idea to use these options.]
Appropriately use compiler options.

{Shell 相关}
The return value of a program will be truncated to the lowest 8 bits,
as the exit status of shell command execution.

=======================================================================================================
Note: Distinguish [Control characters] and [Escaped sequenece]
Escaped sequence - Shell builtin(echo printf) and external commands, C/C++ language specification
Control characters - the characters which is non-printable but have special meaning to the environment.

[Programmers often add print statements during debugging. Such statements
should always flush the stream. Otherwise, if the program crashes, output
may be left in the buffer, leading to incorrect inferences about where the
program crashed.]

[The compiler ignores comments.]
In fact, the preprocessor replace every comment with a space.

[About the implicit conversion of std::istream]
'''CPP
while (std::cin) {
    std::cout << 1 << "\n";
} // will output "1\n" continuously
'''
istream defines an operator overload:
E.g.
std::base_ios::operator bool() const
{
}
So it can be used in a conditional test expression.

[Entering an End-of-File from the Keyboard]
Windows: Ctrl-z
Unix-like: Ctrl-d

[By default, reading cin flushes cout; cout is also flushed when the program
ends normally.]
std::cout 缓存输出，需要flush才会执行系统调用把实际内容写入stdout.
std::flush, std::endl 这两种manipulator起到flush作用
Qt的logger在每次operator << 之后会立刻flush, 不会丢失输出

An analysis of standard library output stream(i.e. ostream)
1. cout {bind /dev/stdout, buffer}
2. cerr {bind /dev/stderr, not buffer}
3. clog {bind /dev/stderr, buffer}
Although they always connect to the same device(pseduo terminal in Unix-like systems).

Distinguish top-level and low-level const qualifier.
赋值运算时，若rvalue's type is low-level but lvalue isn't, the compiler will complain.

const versus constexpr
The const-qualified type can be initialized from a runtime non-const expression.

[A declaration can involve only a single base type].

[In particular, when we use a reference as an initializer, the
initializer is the corresponding object]
使用类型推导的时候，对于reference type 不可以省略ampersand (&)

[Second, auto ordinarily ignores top-level consts (§ 2.4.3, p. 63). As usual in
initializations, low-level consts, such as when an initializer is a pointer
to const, are kept]
Top-level const qualifier will be ignored, so when needed, specify it explicitly.

[The way decltype handles top-level const and references differs subtly from the
way auto does.]

int &r { ... };
decltype(r) // int & (lvalue)
decltype(r + 0) // int (prvalue)
                //
[Whenever a header is updated, the source files that use that header must be
recompiled to get the new or changed declarations.]

C++中 字符串常量是lvalue, 有地址!
std::is_same_v<decltype("abbccc"), const char(&)[7]> == true>

注意 the return type of string::size() is string::size_type
