`su` stands for 'Switch User'

intro-linux书如其名，是一些比较基础的介绍

The kernel is fully loaded to memory by bootloader at once, after that, all
executable files(images) are linked to physical memory through kernel mm
subsystem.
加载可执行文件的过程被内核mm子系统通过【按需加载页】,【mmap】等技术优化。

The shell allows the user to handle a system in a very flexible way.
task automation

The abstract of VFS subsystem:
In VFS, filenames are managed via dentry structure. dentry contains a pointer
to inode, which contains the metadata and data block of the file.

Note the dentry and inode data structure of kernel VFS subsystem.

我发现我在文件里找关键字的时候总喜欢 cat file | grep keyword,太搓了。
不如grep keyword file..., 效率高，击键少。一定要改过来。
